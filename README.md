# React E-COM Website

------------



I created this website using [React](https://reactjs.org/ "React"), [Commerce.js Api](https://commercejs.com/ "Commerce.js Api"), [Material-UI ](http://material-ui.com "Material-UI "), and [Stripe](http://stripe.com "Stripe"). On the home page the first thing you will notice is the navbar with the logo and a  working shopping cart. As you add and remove product from the cart it will display item count. The product on the page is being displayed via the api. I can add and modify product via the [Commerce.js](http://commercejs.com "Commerce.js") api and it will render on my website.  To mangae my payment i used the Stripe Api. Currently the payment method is only set up on test so if you wanna test it just type 424242424242424242 for card number 4242 for date.  Once you place the order you will be sent a test email via Commerce.js to confirm order.
